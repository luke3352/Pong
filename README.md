Once that is done extract this folder and cd into the the PORTFOLIO 1 folder.
Then in the command promp type node app.js, this should start the server.
Next in your browser open up a tab and type localhost:2000, this should load the game and connect to the server.
Open another tab and also type in localhost:2000.
To start the game hit serve ball. 
Use the up and down arrow keys to control the paddle.
